Challenge 
During the setup process, several challenges were encountered that required careful attention and resolution. Initially, installing Windows 11 posed compatibility issues with existing hardware, which were addressed by updating drivers and ensuring all prerequisites were met before proceeding with installation.
Subsequently, installing essential tools such as Python and Docker revealed dependencies and version conflicts. These were managed by utilizing virtual environments for Python and meticulously reviewing Dockerfile configurations to resolve dependencies and ensure compatibility across different components of the development stack.
Configuring Git for version control presented another challenge, particularly in setting up SSH keys and ensuring proper repository configurations on GitHub. This was resolved by following GitHub's documentation on SSH key generation and carefully verifying repository settings to guarantee seamless access and collaboration.
Finally, setting up the MySQL database encountered configuration and connectivity issues. Troubleshooting involved referring to MySQL documentation, adjusting firewall settings, and ensuring correct configuration of connection strings to establish reliable database connectivity.
Throughout these challenges, thorough research, meticulous attention to detail, and leveraging online resources played pivotal roles in overcoming obstacles and ensuring a robust and functional development environment suitable for project requirements.
